Hey, my name is Michail Zarečenskij. I’ve been working at JetBrains for about ten years, contributing to the
Kotlin compiler, the IntelliJ IDEA plugin, and the broader Kotlin ecosystem. These days, my main focus is
the Kotlin language.<br><br>

I’ve started this blog as a space for more informal posts: thoughts, ideas that I occasionally just
want to put into words and share. Many of them will, of course, relate to my work, though not necessarily
represent it in full. So, take anything I say about the future with a grain of salt. And welcome! :)
